# JupiterOS

My own attempt to learn how to make an OS kernel. Based heavily on [James Molloy's tutorials](http://jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/), which have [known issues](https://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy%27s_Tutorial_Known_Bugs).

I've kept the old [README](README) only as a "historic" reference. Eventually, I'll make some time and revamp this code.
